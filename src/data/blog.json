The post itself was a bit interesting to say the least. The tldr of it is some dude struggling to write a simple hello world program in C++ after 3 years of programming. Although I would say that those struggles are a bit extreme (like honestly what have you been learning in the past 3 years ðŸ’€), I wanted to focus more on the overall sentiment of the post. Specifically, I wanted to discuss feeling behind in life and how it's not necessarily a bad thing."
