Help102 is a web app built for the ENGR102 course at Texas A&M, an introductory Python course that's required for all incoming engineering freshmen. The web app provides two main features: a learning page that teaches the course content in a simplified form, and the review page that students can use to help them with any assignment, lab, or exam.

# Purpose

For many students at A&M, freshmen year is one of the most stressful periods of their university life. Due to ETAM, many students who want to get a popular major like computer science or mechanical engineering aim for a 3.75 or higher GPA in order to be auto admitted into their intended major. Those who aren't able to meet the auto GPA threshold face a bleak reality of having to choose a different major. While I personally wasn't worried about not getting a 3.75 GPA (obviously :P), I understand how incredibly stressful it can be. As such, I wanted to lessen the burden for at least one required class. While I may not be a chemistry or physics whizz, I am pretty damn good at this programming thing, so I set my sights on helping hpeople get through the ENGR102 course. Specifically I wanted to target two problems that I thought the course had. Number 1 was that there was too much bloated content that was sometimes really confusing. Number 2 was the lack of academic resoucres like a cheat sheet for a list of important functions or practice tests to help prepare for exams.
