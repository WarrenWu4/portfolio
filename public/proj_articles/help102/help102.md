# help102

A website built for the ENGR102 course taken by all incoming engineering freshmen at Texas A&M.

## Process

The first steps in any project is planning and brainstorming... which I didn't do. I started this project as I was entering college and I was incredibly inexperienced with anything web related. As such, my original goal was mainly to do a little something in order to get my feet wet with web development. I had a general idea of some functions I wanted to implement like adding a lab help section or a review video section. However, I ignored all the functionality thinking making a cool design was all that I needed. Thus, I downloaded Figma and started hacking away at a couple of designs.

### First Try

The above image was my first ever prototype of the help102 home page. Needless to say it was a UI/UX horror. The navigation buttons were too small, the logo looked weird paired with the "ENGR102" text, and the spacing as well as size was a complete mess. I don't think the overall idea in my head was too bad, but the industrial nature of it simply didn't fit an educational website about software nor did it translate well to other parts of the website. Perhaps a more talented web designer could make it work, but as a complete noob, I knew that I had to scrap the idea.

### A Different Vibe

After looking at a couple of different websites, I saw a website that had a really cool parallax effect and I thought that it would be perfect (it wasn't) for the new help102 design. Looking back on it, there were also a ton of UI/UX issues with the design that I completely ignored at the time. Anyways, after I finished coding it, I realized that it was a terrible experience and so I once again had to scrap the idea.

### Adding Some Flare

For the 3rd (ish) design I took a lot of inspiration from themes common in Saas websites like massive text in the hero section. I honestly didn't think the design was too bad, I just struggled finding the proper spacing between each section. I also thought that besides the landing page, the rest of the design for the learn, review, about, etc. pages was incredibly boring and mundane leading me to redesign those pages a couple more times before realizing I needed to change the overall theme of the website to add more dynamic visuals.

### Landing a Look

After a long, long, long, very long period of designing and redesigning (I'll spare you from witnessing all my other designs) I finally landed on something that I felt was just right. It was simple, yet had enough visual dynamics to keep the audiences' attention. Additionally, I actually made a design system ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ (I know), so creating a similar theme with other pages was pretty simple.
