### Help102 is a web app built for the ENGR102 course at Texas A&M, an introductory Python course that's required for all incoming freshmen. The web app provides 2 main resources in the form of a learning page, and a review page.

## Purpose

### After having personally gone through the ENGR102 course, I've realized the shortcomings of the course in terms of how it evaluates students and also the . In some aspects, the course reminded me of those high school classes you were required to take, but never really enjoyed. To me, it felt unfair that some engineering students who intended to major in something that won't use Python also had to take the course. However, the course did incite excitement in some students to pursue computer science. Many people I know decided to change majors after the course, either realizing computer science was or wasn't for them. As such, I created this web app in order help students avoid the painstaking parts of the course and to "get over it."
