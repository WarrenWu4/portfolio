# Why You Should Participate in a Hackathon

I've been meaning to write this article for a while now. Ever since going to my first hackathon back in 2022 when I was still a baby freshman in college. However, it remained an after thought as I became increasingly busy. Now, 2 years and many hackathons later, I've finally decided to sit my ass down and write this article on why you should participate in a hackathon.

Initially when I tried to write this article, I found it incredibly difficult to express the passion and excitement I felt during my hackathon experiences. I'm by no means a gifted writer, but I think many talented authors would also struggle to explain how staring at a screen for 24 hours and sleeping on the floor on a weekend is fun and exciting. Now before you exit out of this page and decide never to do a hackathon, I would like you to give me a chance to convince you otherwise.



For those of y'all out there that aren't incredibly passionate about technology or building cool stuff, I'd say that there are still plently of reasons to go to a hackathon. There's a ton of free stuff (food, snacks, t-shirt, etc.) and usually there are a couple of fun events throughout the hackathon that are pretty fun.
