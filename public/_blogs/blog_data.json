Both my sister and I were busy with our respective internships, but we really wanted to travel some place together and get some quality sibling time. As such the only available time between our internships and school starting again was this small chunk of time in August. Now out of all the places we could've went to, why did I choose Seattle? Well it's because I thought it was the perfect city for me. The weather was cold (especially compared to Texas), I heard that people drive really slowly (especially compared to Texas), and there's a lot of _high paying_ tech jobs."

Now I usually tend to ignore any posts from r/csMajors because a majority of the time it's some pessimistic bum complaining or some elitist flexing their 4 quant offers. However, this post made me pause for a moment, and in that brief moment of thoughtlessness, swayed by my unnerving curiosity, I opened the post and started reading."
