# Programming Nostalgia?

The other day, I was casually scrolling through YouTube and avoiding all of my responsibilites when I came across a game development journey video. Now, the "my journey as a programmer" genre is something that's pretty common (at least on my YouTube feed), so what made me stop and decide to watch it? Well it was partly boredom, but also the title of the video was something that made me rethink a lot of things. 10 years. 10 years. Holy shit 10 years is a long ass time. I'm currently 18 years old at the time of this article so 10 years is over half of my entire life. This dude was grinding away at game development when I was just 8 years old. I think that kind of perspective is really interesting and very needed in this day in age where there are bootcamps and courses out there that "teach" you how to program within months or a couple of weeks. Frankly I think those type of content are straight bullshit. Software engineering, development, programming, etc. is a lifelong skill where you learn new things everyday. Are there people who still use an old tech stack?

## Wait what about me?

Seeing this video has been really eye-opening to me as a student who wants to go out to the professional world and build cool shit. I think that a lot of people tend to overeager to get into a area of development which often leads them to have a bad foundation on how to program good. Understanding what goes under the hood of a NextJS application or how the web works

## A long, long journey

It's tough being patient. But you have to take your time

## There's so much to learn

There are many areas of computer science that I want to get into and study. However there's forever an internal trade off between the coolness of it and how much it will actually benefit me.

## The power of looking back

Damn I was a shit programmer back in high school, but look at me now.

Peace out ✌️.
