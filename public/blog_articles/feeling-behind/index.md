# Damn Am I Bad At Programming?

The other day I was browsing around Reddit and laughing my ass off at the shithousery going on with the whole NextJS app router fiasco when I came across a post titled "Why is everyone godlike in comparison to me?" The post itself was a bit interesting to say the least. The tldr of it is some dude struggling to write a simple hello world program in C++ after 3 years of programming. Although I would say that those struggles are a bit extreme (like honestly what have you been learning in the past 3 years üíÄ), I wanted to focus more on the overall sentiment of the post. Specifically, I wanted to discuss feeling behind in life and how I've learned to embrace it.

For some context, at the time of writing this article I'm an 18 year old computer science student. I'm nearing the end of my summer internship and about to head into my sophmore year at college.
. I'm also someone who likes comparisons, because whether you think it's "toxic" or not, it's a good way for me to calculate my chances and try to stay ahead of the curve for career opportunities and I don't use it to maliciously judge others are think I'm superior. As such, when I compare myself to the average computer science student at my age, I would rank myself above average in terms of experience and practical knowledge. However, for me, being average isn't enough. I have my own dreams and goals that I want to accomplish and I don't think living an average life, or even an above average life would make me satisifed. As such, I've started to push myself to do more, to learn more, to network more. At some point I stopped comparing myself to the mean and started looking at those further ahead of me. Is it a bad thing? No, I think that if you have big goals you want to accomplish (more than just getting a cushy job) then you should aim to be a lot better than average. Essentially how much you expect out of yourself should reflect your goals. If all you want is to get a decent job, then sure expecting

Now I'm still an 18 year old so the people reading this might not give a shit because of my age, hell when I grow older maybe I'll have a different sentiment, but this is what I think so far and I'm going to keep feeling behind.

- reddit posts about people feeling dumb
- never feeling that you're good enough
- always comparing yourself to other people and seeing how great they are
- my own programming journey
- job market & rise of AI & being "younger"

- 10 year game dev showing how long it takes to truly be decent at something
- everyone has their own areas of expertise and it's impossible to know everything
- am I doing too much? working on multiple projects on my own time and learning about new things?

- feeling behind can be stressful as you constantly feel the need to work harder, faster, more efficiently in order to accomplish the goals you want
- programming is something that requires continuous learning & so feeling content is dangerous
- not here to point out any solutions as I'm still dealing with the feeling, just here for people that feel the same way and to tell them they're not alone
- maybe in 10 years I'll feel comfortable and content
- power of looking back

Peace out ‚úåÔ∏è.
