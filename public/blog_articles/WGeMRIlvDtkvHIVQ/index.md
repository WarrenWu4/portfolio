# Damn Am I Bad At Programming?

---

The other day I was browsing around Reddit and laughing my ass off at the shithousery going on with the whole NextJS app router fiasco when I came across a post titled "Why is everyone godlike in comparison to me?"

Instantly I felt a connection with the author of this post. In fact, I would bet good money that many other programmers also had a similar thought, especially early on in their careers.
