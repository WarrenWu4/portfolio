# Damn Am I Bad At Programming?

---

The other day I was browsing around Reddit, laughing my ass off at the shithousery going on with the whole NextJS app router fiasco, when I came across a post titled "Why is everyone godlike in comparison to me?"

Instantly I felt a connection with the author. In fact, I would bet good money that many other programmers also had a similar thought.

For some context, at the time of writing this article, I'm an 18 year old computer science student. I'm nearing the end of my summer internship and about to head into my sophmore year at college. Even though I would say that I'm above average in terms of skill and experience (for my age), I can't help but compare myself to other amazing devs I've seen/met. Whenever I'm browsing trending GitHub repos, I see the crazy cool stuff that people are building and I feel like a massive idiot.

The frustrating reality of computer science is that in order to become a better software developer, you simply need more experience. You don't become a good software developer in 6 months by taking some bullshit bootcamp or watching 4 hour YouTube videos. Becoming a better software developer means encountering more problems, fixing those problems, and improving your general understanding of what the actual fuck you're building. I feel like the process of becoming a better software developer has become increasingly more difficult with the apperance of more modern tools that add layers upon layers of abstractions which dampens the need to learn the stuff under the hood. As such, when shit hits the fan and something in production breaks, you're left clueless on how to actually fix anything more complicated than centering a div. On the other hand, if you choose to learn from the ground up, oftentimes you focus on a specific niche and when you're building a full-stack app that requires knowledge of something else... well fuck you're going to have to wing it or spend another good chunk of your life learning about it.

In my not so humble opinion, if you're a regular college student, you can afford to spend a couple of years building a good foundation before moving on to the real world. Ideally you would learn a little, build a mini project, learn while building the project, and repeat. However I'm not exactly a regular college student. I have greater ambitions beyond just getting a comfy job, so the sooner I can become a 10x developer the better. The pressure to produce more as a developer has also increased with jobs being more scarce and the economy shitting the bed, although that's an article for another day.

To answer the original question: "am I bad at programming?" No, but it sure feels like it sometimes ðŸ˜©.
