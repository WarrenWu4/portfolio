I'm also a big nerd that loves to experiment with different designs and I'm always exploring new technologies. When I'm not immersed in code or exploring new tech, you'll find me unwinding by watching YouTube or jamming out to songs on Spotify. I love meeting and getting to know new people, so feel free to connect/contact me if you think I'm pretty chill dude :D.",
