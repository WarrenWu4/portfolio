    "about": "I'm currently a computer science sophomore at Texas A&M, dedicated to creating mission-driven software that leaves a positive impact on the world. With a love for minimalistic designs and an insatiable curiosity for incorporating cutting-edge technologies into my workflow, I'm always on the lookout for innovative ways to enhance productivity and user experiences. When I'm not immersed in code or exploring new tech, you'll find me unwinding by watching YouTube or jamming out to my Spotify playlist. Side note: I'm also obsessed with clouds and blobs. I love meeting and getting to know new people, so feel free to connect/contact me if you think I'm pretty chill dude.",
