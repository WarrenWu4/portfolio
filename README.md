Yo wassup, this is my portfolio website repo. I say "portfolio," but it acts more like a blog site where I document my projects and experiences in detail rather than begging companies for a job (don't worry I do that irl). I wanted my portfolio to be more of a museum/time capsule thing where in 5 years I can look back and say "wow this douchebag really made this shitty product." All jokes aside, while I don't think this is the flashiest-looking portfolio I could've made, I believe the overall theme and design epitomizes the essence of who I am: a simple man who likes to code. Peace out ✌️.

Socials are also on the portfolio website, but I'll put them here anyways lol.

### Easter Egg

There's a secret access code somewhere on the site that you can use for another project of mine called [Blackbox](https://github.com/WarrenWu4/blackbox).
